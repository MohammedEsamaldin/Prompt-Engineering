 generate prompts for LLMs to extract relevant entities from job descriptions and also to classify web pages given only a few examples of human scores.
Entity Extraction with Generative Models
This notebook demonstrates how to use Cohere's generative models to extract the name of a film from the title of an article. This demonstrates Named Entity Recognition (NER) of entities which are harder to isolate using other NLP methods (and where pre-training provides the model with some context on these entities). This also demonstrates the broader usecase of sturctured generation based on providing multiple examples in the prompt.
